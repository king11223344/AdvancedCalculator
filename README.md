### What I learned

One of my favorite projects that and a project that I wanted to create since day one of learning web development. It feels ten times cooler because now I'm built it with modern tools such as: `React`, `TailwindCSS`, etc. `TailwindCSS` came in handy to make all the themes and change the colors easily. I feel like every other option out there, such as using `CSS :root variables` would've made the matter a lot harder than it is. What comes to the main functionality of the app, I was planning on making it with just `useState`, but once I managed to do that pretty easily, I wanted to make this a bit more challenging. So, I went to research `useReducer`, after a bunch of videos, articles and reading the docs, I managed to build it with just `useReducer`. Will definitely use `useReducer` in the upcoming projects. As an addition I added a small section in the main display, that will show the previous number, current number and the operation, so the user doesn't have to guess what's happening behind the scenes. I hope you'll enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed coding it!

### Useful resources

- [useReducer from React's new docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/usereducer) - As of 05/04/2022 this React doc is in beta mode, yet it's fresh and cool to play with and learn.
- [useReducer article](https://medium.com/gitconnected/reuse-reduce-usereducer-5f11f2dd1e98) - A cool article that helped me to get started with useReducer.
